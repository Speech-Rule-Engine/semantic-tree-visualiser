# Semantic Tree Visualiser

A simple visualiser for the semantic tree produced by the 
[speech-rule-engine](https://github.com/zorkow/speech-rule-engine) for MathML elements.


## Run

Load visualise.html into a browser and load a sample from the samples directory, e.g.,

    samples/quad.json

for the quadratic equation. This currently only works via a URL, i.e., not locally from files.

For left-right trees, change the ```direction``` option to ```left-right```.

## Test

Play with the visualiser online on [github pages](http://zorkow.github.io/semantic-tree-visualiser/visualise.html).
